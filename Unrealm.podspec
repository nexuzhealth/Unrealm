Benefits:
Enables you to store Swift native types (Structs, Classes, Enums, Arrays, Dictionaries, etc...)
Getting rid of redundant inheriting from Object class
Getting rid of Realm crashes like "Object has been deleted or invalidated"
Getting rid of Realm crashes like "Realm accessed from incorrect thread"
Getting rid of boilerplate code such @objc dynamic var. Use just var or let
